      <h2>My Journey in VIT</h2>
      <div class="multi-column">
        <p>Joining VIT was a life-changing decision for me. From the very first day, the atmosphere was energetic, filled with students from diverse backgrounds and interests. I still remember my orientation, where I got my first glimpse of the academic opportunities and vibrant campus life ahead.</p>

        <p>As semesters passed, I got involved in various clubs and hackathons, which helped me grow beyond textbooks. I made friends who were not just classmates but also collaborators in late-night projects, event organizing, and even weekend getaways.</p>

        <p>The faculty at VIT have been incredibly supportive. Whether it was doubts in lectures, guidance for research, or simply motivational advice, they were always there to help. Their encouragement pushed me to take up internships and contribute to real-world projects.</p>

        <p>One of the most unforgettable parts of my journey was participating in Riviera and Gravitas. These fests brought the campus alive — filled with colors, music, ideas, and endless enthusiasm. I even got the chance to showcase a tech demo in front of industry professionals!</p>

        <p>As I near the end of my time here, I realize how much VIT has shaped me. It gave me confidence, skills, and countless memories. I’ll always carry a piece of VIT with me as I step into the future.</p>
